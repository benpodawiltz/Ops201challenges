## Ops 201 Challenges
> Welcome! This the README file for the ops 201 challenges 

1. This repository is all about my introduction to scripting using Bash and Powershell

2. I am learning these skills to automate tasks and build the first bricks in my foundation for future technology practices

3. Fundamental concepts in basic script automation utilizing the following:
    1. Variables
    2. Functions
    3. For Loops
    4. While/do/done
    5. if/else/elif/fi
    6. Arrays
    7. Echo/print commands
    8. read

4. Tools utilized in the following scripts:
    1. kill processes - psaux and kill
    2. fetch network adaptor info
    3. netcat - scan for open ports
    4. system hardware and BIOS data - lshw
    5. batch file for backup - ROBOCOPY 
    6. Powershell EventLog functions
    7. Analyze, initalize, terminate processes - Get-Process
    8. Firewall administration - Netsh advfirewall
    9. Powershell - Select-string to identify patterns
    10. Domain query - whois, dig, host, nslookup

5. My favorite Ops challenge was the last one (10) as my skills are getting better, slowly. Like glacier slow...

6.  How do scripts relate to the workplace? time=money and by automating tasks I can create time by stacking processes into a script to move more efficently at the jobsite and eradicate redundant tasks. I am looking forward to applying some scripting to my own personal backups on my own PC.

7. I would like to improve all of the previous scripts. They all need work for clarity, creativity, and fuctionality.

8. Scipting I would like to improve on inlcudes:
    * utilizing variables to assign options for
    * building more user input data 
    * continue to research and apply what I find
