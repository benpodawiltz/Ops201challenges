## Ops 201 Challenges
> Welcome! This the README file for the ops 201 challenges!

1. This repository is all about my introduction to scripting using Bash and Powershell
2. I am learning these skills to automate tasks and build the first bricks in my foundation for future technology practices
3. Fundamental concepts in basic script automation utilizing the following:
    a. Variables
    b. Functions
    c. For Loops
    d. While/do/done
    e. if/else/elif/fi
    f. Arrays
    g. Echo/print commands
    h. read

4. Tools utilized in the following scripts:
    a. kill processes - psaux and kill
    b. fetch network adaptor info
    c. netcat - scan for open ports
    d. system hardware and BIOS data - lshw
    e. batch file for backup - ROBOCOPY 
    f. Powershell EventLog functions
    j. Analyze, initalize, terminate processes - Get-Process
    h. Firewall administration - Netsh advfirewall
    i. Powershell - Select-string to identify patterns
    k. Domain query - whois, dig, host, nslookup

5. My favorite Ops challenge was the last one (13) as my skills are getting better, slowly. Like glacier slow...
6. I am looking forward to applying some scripting to my own personal backups on my own PC. How do they relate to the workplace? time=money and by automating tasks I can create time by stacking processes into a script to move more efficently at the jobsite. Also to eradicate redundant tasks. 
7. I would like to improve all of the previous scripts. They all need work for clarity, creativity, and fuctionality.
8. Scipting I would like to improve on inlcudes:
    a. utilizing assignment of options in variables
    b. building in more user input data and response to options assigned to variables
    c. continue to research and apply what I find
